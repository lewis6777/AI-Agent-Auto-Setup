# AI-Agent-Auto-Setup

**This is for the AI Agents Auto Setup unity package I made for the Gorilla Tag custom maps example project.**

If you encounter bugs or have suggestions, you can leave them on the **Issues** tab.

## How to use
To use this package, first head over to the releases tab of the github, and download the **.unitypackage**
Then, go into your unity project, right click in the Assets folder (Project window) and click **Import Package/Custom Package...**

Now, go to Tools/AI Agent Setup.
From here, you can set up the agents.
Make sure you hover over each element, as most have an explanation to what they do.

Once you've set up the agent, you can go to **Assets/Agents** to find it.
Here you can add a model to your agent, or configure its values like **speed** and **acceleration**.
